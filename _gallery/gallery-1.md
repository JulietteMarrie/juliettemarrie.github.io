title: Illustration of the inverse and forward rendering between 2D visual features (produced by DINOv2) and a 3D Gaussian Splatting scene. In the inverse rendering (or uplifting) phase, features are created for each 3D Gaussian by aggregating coarse 2D features over all viewing directions. For forward rendering, the 3D features are projected on any given viewing direction as in regular Gaussian Splatting.

description: Recently, I worked on transferring visual representations produced by 2D visual models such as DINOv2 and SAM into 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. My study showed that a simple, learning-free aggregation of 2D features is very effective, standing out from prior work relying on gradient-based optimization.
