I am a postdoctoral researcher at Kyutai, working on integrating visual understanding into audio-language models.

I completed a PhD at NAVER LABS Europe and INRIA Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes, THOTH team, under the supervision of Julien Mairal, Diane Larlus, and Michael Arbel (2022-2025).
My PhD research focused on visual representation learning, knowledge distillation, and 3D scene understanding. 
Before my PhD, I graduated from Mines Paris with a focus in Applied Mathematics and obtained a Master’s Degree in Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision (MVA) from ENS Paris-Saclay (2021).
