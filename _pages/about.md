I am a 3rd-year PhD student at NAVER LABS Europe and INRIA Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes, THOTH team, under the supervision of Julien Mairal, Diane Larlus, and Michael Arbel. I graduated from Mines Paris with a focus in Applied Mathematics and obtained a Master’s Degree in Mathematics, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision (MVA) from ENS Paris-Saclay (2021). 


My current research focuses on visual representation learning, with an emphasis on leveraging large pretrained visual models for applications constrained by computational resources or data scarcity. I have worked on automatically learning data augmentation for supervised tasks, and on transferring generic representations from large pretrained models into smaller ones (knowledge distillation) and into 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes.


## Professional experience

- **2021**: 6-month internship at Philips Research (France) on self-supervised learning from 3D medical images.

- **2020**: 6-month internship at Weill Cornell Medicine and the NYGC (Landau Lab, New York) on phylogenetic tree reconstruction from microsatellite sequences.

- **2019**: 6-month internship at Neural Concept (start-up in EPFL) on 3D shape optimization using Geometric Deep Learning


## Teaching

**African Masters of Machine Intelligence (AMMI) 2023 and 2024 - Saly, Senegal** <br>
I served as a teaching assistant for two-week courses on Kernel Methods, taught by Jean-Philippe Vert, in July 2023 and July 2024.
