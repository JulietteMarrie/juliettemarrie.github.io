In the inverse rendering (or uplifting) phase, features are created for each 3D Gaussian by aggregating coarse 2D features over all viewing directions. For forward rendering, the 3D features are projected on any given viewing direction as in regular Gaussian Splatting.

We address the task of uplifting visual features or semantic masks from 2D vision models to 3D scenes represented by Gaussian Splatting. Whereas common approaches rely on iterative optimization-based procedures, we show that a simple yet effective aggregation technique yields excellent results. Applied to semantic masks from Segment Anything (SAM), our uplifting approach leads to segmentation quality comparable to the state of the art. We then extend this method to generic DINOv2 features, integrating 3D scene geometry through graph diffusion, and achieve competitive segmentation results despite DINOv2 not being trained on millions of annotated masks like SAM.
